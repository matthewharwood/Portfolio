# Morning Harwood

A Portfolio by Matthew harwood

This is a working example of a SSG with partial(selective) hydration[âš¡ðŸ§©ðŸ’¦].

## Why

> The server and client render should not be 1:1.
> Don't render buttons on the server that require JS to work.
> Don't ship code to the client that simply repeats what the server has already done
