      "The agency AKQA and their client Nike Jordan worked together to complete dozens of champaign webpages. Nike ran the majority of the creative process with their in-house copywriters, photographers, and creative directors.  AKQA was the production muscle, bring together all the creative assets into a www.nike.com hosted webpage.  Both Nike and AKQA did great work together; however, AKQA’s goal was to have more creative ownership.  Unfortunatly for AKQA this ownership was seemingly impossible.  The process between AKQA and Nike was fragemented, we were given hard deadlines, short production times, and low budgets.  All of which, created a bottleneck that essentially blocked any progress towards more creative ownership. We had a mission to fix this fragemented process by bridging the the communication gap between Client Nike and Agency AKQA.",

    text: `Our design prompt was but a utterance over lunch about replacing a leaving employee with a robot.  We were unsure of what we were out to solve. Regardless, we put on our designers hats and went to best resource we knew at the time IDEO’s Method Cards. We better shaped our problem by journey mapping the process between AKQA and Nike 2014’s March Madness Campaign. Our journey map reveal that the process had many pain points: 

- Launches were often tied to an event and therefore deadlines were non-negotiable.
- Creative handoffs often bleed into execution timelines.
- Expensive production cost in both design and technology departements.
- Physical distance between AKQA and Nike caused long feedback turn arounds.
- AKQA Designers used Photoshop which didn’t offer a good solution for Responsive design.
- Nike’s CMS CQ5 was slow and required a certified trained Authorer to use it.

 These pain points were used to help framed the product requirements.
